The translationStudio for the Desktop program enables translators to do offline translating of the Bible or of Bible resources. It can be used for two purposes:

* For translators to translate the Bible (or Open Bible Stories) from English to a gateway language, or from a gateway language to a mother tongue

* For Gateway language translators to translate Bible resources from English to a gateway language

The program contains the content that needs to be translated as well as translationHelps (See: `Using the translationHelps (Resources) <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/Helps.rst>`_). You can share information directly from device to device, and you can upload finished content to Door43 where it can be digitally published.

Installation
-------------

This process requires an Internet connection.

  1. Go to: https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/ts-desktop/releases/tag/11.1

  2. Click the appropriate file for your computer:

    * The file with “linux” in the name is for a Linux operating system.

    * The file with “osx” in the name is for an Apple Macintosh operating system.

    * The file with “win_x32” in the name is for a 32-bit Windows operating system.

    * The file with “win_x64” in the name is for a 64-bit Windows operating system.
    
      (To determine if your Windows PC is a 32-bit or a 64-bit operating system, open the Control Panel and click System.)

  3. Designate where you want to save the file.
 
  4. Allow the file to download to the computer. 

  5. Double-click the file name to start the install.
 
  6. Click Run or Yes on the Warning message window and any other warning messages. 
 
  7. Choose the language that will be used during the installation from the dropdown menu.
 
  8. Click Next on the 'Welcome to the translationStudio Setup Wizard' window.
 
  9. Select the I accept the agreement radio button for the software license. Click Next.
 
  10. Select the choice to 'create a desktop icon' if you wish. Click Next.
 
  11. Click Install. 
 
  12. Please wait for the program to be installed.  This may take several minutes. The installer installs translationStudio and Git, which is a version control system.
 
  13. At the *Completing the translationStudio Setup Wizard* window, click Finish to complete the installation.
  
Opening translationStudio
---------------------------------------------------

Complete these steps to open translationStudio: 

  *	If you chose to create a desktop icon during installation, double-click the desktop icon.
 
  *	If you did not choose to create a desktop icon you will need to find the program:

    * Click the "start" icon on your computer or press the Windows key on your keyboard.

    * Find translationStudio in the list of programs and click to open it.

2.	Create or login to your account. See `Login Options`_ for more information.

Login Options
-------------

When translationStudio first opens, you are presented with a request to create or log in to an account. 
There are two types of accounts that you can use:

* **Offline Account** – user has full use of the program except for uploading to Door43. You may want to start with an offline account and then switch to a Door43 account later when you want to upload your work (the work is attached to the device, not to the account).  

* **Door43 Account** – user has full use of the program and can upload to Door43 (requires Internet connection.)

Using an offline account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not want to create a new Door43 account at this time or are not able to connect to the Internet, you can create an offline account:

1.	On the opening screen, click **Create offline Account**. The login screen opens.

2.	Tap the **Your Name or Pseudonym** field. 

3.	Type your user name or pseudonym into the field, and then click **Continue**. You may use a pseudonym instead of your real name. A pseudonym is a name that cannot be traced back to you. You may wish to use a pseudonym if you are working in a sensitive part of the world. 

4.	Tap **Continue** to acknowledge the privacy notice.

Using an existing Door43 account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are connected to the internet want to use an existing Door43 account, you can click **Login with Door43 account**. Enter your Door43 credentials to log in.

Creating a new Door43 account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not have a Door43 account, but you wish to be able to use an Internet connection to upload your work to Door43, you can create a Door43 account:

1.	Click **Create new Door43 Account** to create a new Door43 user account. The Door43 Account Creation window opens. (This requires an Internet connection.)

2.	Click the **Your Name or Pseudonym** field and type your name or pseudonym into the field. This is the display name -- the name that will be listed as a contributor to any project files on this device. (Because names are publicly available, you may prefer to use a pseudonym. Make up any pseudonym of your choice.)

3.	Click the **Email Address** line to enter your email address.

4.	Enter your name or pseudonym in the **Login name** field. This is your Door43 user name that you will use to log in to Door43 and to the translationStudio app. If you used a pseudonym in step (2) above, enter the same pseudonym here.

5.	Enter a password in both fields. Click **Show Passwords** at the bottom of the screen to display the passwords.

6.	Confirm the information, and then click **Continue** to begin registration.

7.	Click **Continue** to acknowledge the privacy notice.

Logging Out
-----------

You do not need to log out of the app before you close it. If you do not log out, when you reopen translationStudio you will still be logged in.

However, you may want to log out to change the logged-in user. For example, you may do your work offline with an offline account, but when you want to upload your work you need to use a Door43 account.

At any time you can perform the following steps to access the initial screen to change login or translator settings:

*	From the *Your Translation Projects* (home) screen:
  
  *	Click the 3-dot icon at the lower left of your screen to invoke the options menu. 
  
  *	Click **Log out**.

OR
  
  *	Click **Logout** at the top right of the screen next to the user name.

Agreeing to Terms of Use
-------------------------------

After you have logged in for the first time, translationStudio displays the Terms of Use. Read and agree with each of the statements in the Terms of Use by performing the following steps:

1.	Click each statement.
 
2.	Scroll through the text to read the entire statement. Click Close for each statement.
 
3.	When you have read all statements, click I Agree. 
 
Note: At any time you can view the License Agreement, Statement of Faith, Translation Guidelines and the Software Licenses information from the Settings Menu. (See: `tS for Desktop: Modifying Program Settings <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/dSettings.rst>`_)

4.	The program opens to the *Your Translation Projects* screen (which is the home screen). The first time you use the program you have no existing projects, so the home screen displays a welcome message.

Setup Steps
-----------

How do I set up to translate the Bible or Open Bible Stories?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using translationStudio to translate the Bible or Open Bible Stories, you need to enable Blind Edit Mode. You can enable Blind Edit Mode at any time for existing projects or for new projects that are doing this type of translation.

To enable Blind Edit Mode, perform the following steps:

1.	Click the three dots at the lower left of the window to open the Options menu and select Settings. 
 
2.	In the Settings window select the checkbox next to Blind Edit Mode to enable it.
 
3.	In the breadcrumbs at the top left of the screen, click Home to return to the home screen. 

How do I set up to translate Bible resources?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using translationStudio to translate Bible resources (translationNotes , translationQuestions, or translationWords) from English into a Gateway language, there is a setup step that you need to perform prior to starting a project.

You must set translationStudio to use Gateway Language Mode so that the resources are available to be translated. Setting this mode does not affect existing projects, if any. It affects only the options that you see when creating new projects.

To use Gateway Language Mode for new projects, perform the following steps:

1.	Click the three dots at the lower left of the window to open the Options menu and select Settings. 
 
2.	In the Settings window select the checkbox next to Gateway Language Mode to enable it.
 
3.	In the breadcrumbs at the top left of the screen, click Home to return to the home screen.
