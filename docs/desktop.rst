The translationStudio for the Desktop program enables translators to do offline translating of the Bible or of Bible resources. It can be used for two purposes:

* For translators to translate the Bible (or Open Bible Stories) from English to a gateway language, or from a gateway language to a mother tongue

* For Gateway language translators to translate Bible resources from English to a gateway language

The program contains the content that needs to be translated as well as translationHelps (See: How to Use the translationHelps in translationStudio). You can share information directly from device to device, and you can upload finished content to Door43 where it can be digitally published.

How do I set up to work on a Gateway Language translation?
If you are using translationStudio to translate Bible resources (translationNotes , translationQuestions, or translationWords) from English into a Gateway language, there is a setup step that you need to perform prior to starting a project.
You must set translationStudio to use Gateway Language Mode so that the resources are available to be translated. Setting this mode does not affect existing projects, if any. It affects only the options that you see when creating new projects.
To use Gateway Language Mode for new projects, perform the following steps:
1.	Click the three dots at the lower left of the window to open the Options menu and select Settings. 
 

2.	Select the checkbox next to Gateway Language Mode to enable it.
 

3.	In the breadcrumbs at the top left, click Home to return to the home screen.
