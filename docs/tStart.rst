Starting a Translation Project
==============================

A translation project consists of:

1. A target language - the language *into which* you will be translating

2. A project category - *what* you will be translating, such as Open Bible Stories or a book of the Bible

3. A source language and text - the language and text *from which* you will be translating, such as the English ULB (Unlocked Literal Bible)

So, to start a translation project, you must specify each of these elements.

Begin by clicking the blue plus sign on the home screen to start defining a new project. When you first start using translationStudio,
there is also a green **Start a New Translation** button on the home screen that you can use to start a new project.



How do I select the target language?
------------------------------------

When you start a new project, you need to choose the target language (the mother tongue language *into which* you will be translating).

1.	Choose your target language (the one you will be translating to):

    *	Swipe up (place a finger on the white area and slide up) to find the target language  

  OR 
  
    *	Tap the magnifying glass icon   located at the top right of the screen. 
 
    The search field opens and the keyboard appears. 

2.  Type the first few letters of your language to narrow the language list. 
 
3.	Tap your language to select it. 
    
What if you cannot find the desired target language? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you do not see your language in the list of target languages, first try alternate spellings, dialect names, and any variant names for your language. If you still can't find it, you can request that your language be added.

The best way to submit a request is to send an email to help@door43.org. Another method is to use the Feedback option from the options menu to submit a Bug Report. In either case, please provide as much information as you can about the language, such as the local name of the language, any other names it is known by, approximate number of speakers, where it is spoken, any similar languages, any published works in that language, etc.

Use Feedback in the 3-dot options menu to request a new language:

1.	From any screen in translationStudio, tap the 3-dot icon   on the left or bottom.

2.	In the list of options, tap Feedback.

3.	The Feedback screen opens. Type the name of the language you would like added to translationStudio. Provide the location pf the speakers and other names the language is known by. If you used a language that is already in the APP, tell which language you used.

4.	Tap Confirm to send your request.
 
Note that even after requesting a new language, certain approvals are required before it will be added to translationStudio. Until your language is added to the APP, use English Demo1 or English Demo2. You will need to use the Feedback option from the options menu to send a comment stating that you used another language for your own. Once your translation has been received, the tS workers will put it in the correct language. Your translation will then show in your language.
