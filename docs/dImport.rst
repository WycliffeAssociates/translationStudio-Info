The translationStudio program enables you to import a project from various sources. To import a project, start from the Home page:

You could also search for another user's project:

2. Type in the Door43 User Name of the user whose project you want to import.

Another possibility is to search for a project by the book name or language:

2. Type in either the book abbreviation or the language code in the right field, or a combination of both (for example, fr_eph for French Ephesians).

Once you have located the project you wish to import:

1. Click the desired file to import it, or click **CANCEL** to close the option and return to the Import Options menu.

2. If you import the file, you receive a success message. Click **CLOSE** to close the window.
