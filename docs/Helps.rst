Using the translationHelps (Resources)
======================================

To help translators make the best translation possible, translationHelps have been created. Once you have consulted the translationHelps, then you are ready to make the best translation. Please use these resources when checking your translation!

The Resources include:

translationWords 
----------------

The translationWords are important terms found in Open Bible Stories and the Bible. It is crucial that they be translated correctly. Each translationWord has a small article written about it as well as cross-references to other places that term is used in Open Bible Stories and the Bible to ensure that it has been translated correctly there, too.
See	https://unfoldingword.org/tw/

translationQuestions
--------------------

The translationQuestions are comprehension questions that can be used to check the translation. These questions can be asked of anyone checking the translation work. Can the Target Language translation be used to correctly answer each of the questions? Read the question, answer the question from the information in the translated text, look at the answer in the program. Do both of the answers match? If so, then the translation is clear and accurate.

For Open Bible Stories questions, see	https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home.

For Bible questions, see	https://unfoldingword.org/tq/

translationNotes
----------------

The translationNotes are cultural, linguistic, and exegetical notes that help to describe and explain the context in which the stories from Open Bible Stories and the Bible were written. They also inform the translator of translation options available to them. See Using the translationNotes for more information.

Using the translationNotes
---------------------------

To Translate from the ULB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*	Read the ULB. Do you understand the meaning of the text so that you can accurately, clearly and naturally translate the meaning into your language?

  * YES? Start translating.

  * NO? Look at the UDB if you have selected it as one of your source texts. Does the UDB help you understand the meaning of the ULB text?
  
      * YES? Start translating.
      
      *	NO? Read the translation notes for help.
      
Translation Notes are words or phrases copied from the ULB and then explained. In English, every note that explains the ULB starts with a bullet point, the ULB text in bold followed by a dash, and then translation suggestions or information for the translator. 

For example:

 *	**copied ULB text** - translation suggestion or information for the translator 


There are many different types of notes in the Translation Notes. Each type of note gives the explanation in a different way. Knowing the type of note will help translators make decisions on the best way to translate the Bible text into their language.

* Notes with Definitions - Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format.

* Notes that Explain - Simple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format.

Suggested Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several types of suggested translations.

* Notes with Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases - There are times that the notes provide a translation suggestion that can replace the word or phrases in the ULB. These replacements can fit into the sentence without changing the meaning of the sentence. These are synonyms and equivalent phrases and are written in double-quotes. These mean the same as the text in the ULB.

* Notes with Alternate Translations (AT) - An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form. The alternate translation should only be used when the ULB form or content will not fit into the form of your language.

* Notes that Include a Quote from the UDB - There may be no note if the UDB provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may be text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. There will be "(UDB)" after the text from the UDB.

* Notes that have Alternate Meanings - Alternate meanings refer to when there are multiple ways to express something or when there are different understandings of what the word or phrase means.

* Notes with Possible Meanings - Sometimes Bible scholars do not know for sure, or do not agree on, what a particular phrase or sentence in the Bible means. Some reasons for this include: there are minor differences in the ancient Bible texts, or a word may have more than one meaning or use, or it may not be clear what a word (such as a pronoun) refers to in a particular phrase.

* Notes that Identify Figures of Speech - In the notes there will be an explanation on how to translate the Figure of Speech that is in the passage. Sometimes an Alternate Translation (AT:) is provided. There will also be a link to the translationAcademy page for additional information and translation strategies to help the translator accurately translate for the meaning of the passage.

* Notes that Identify Indirect and Direct Quotes - There are two kinds of quotations: direct quotation and indirect quotation. When translating a quotation, translators need to decide whether to translate it as a direct quotation or an indirect quotation.

* Notes for Long ULB Phrases - Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts afterward. The longer phrase is broken down so that translation suggestions for parts of the phrase can be explained for each part.

Notes with Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Sometimes you may not know what a word in the ULB means. The notes may have a definition or a description of the word or phrase to help you understand what it means.

**Translation Notes Examples**

Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:

* It is like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another and say, 'We played a flute for you (Matthew 11:16-17 ULB)

 * marketplace - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods

 * flute - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end

* ...people who dress in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' palaces (Luke 7:25 ULB)

 * kings' palaces - a large, expensive house that a king lives in

**Translation Principles**

*	Use words that are already part of your language if possible.

* Keep expressions short if possible.

* Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.

**Translation Strategies**

See `Translate Unknowns`_ for more information on translating words or phrases that are not known in your language.

Notes that Explain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Sometimes you may not know what a word or phrase in the ULB means. And sometimes the same word or phrase is also used in the UDB. So the word or phrase is explained in the notes. These explanations are meant to help you understand the word or phrase. Do not translate the explanations into your Bible. Instead use them to help you understand the meanings so you can translate the Bible text correctly.

**Translation Notes Examples**

Simple explanations about words or phrases are written as full sentences. They begin with a capital letter and end with a period (".").

For example: 

The fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. (Luke 5:2 ULB)

*	washing their nets - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish. 

* If you did not know that fishermen used nets to catch fish, you might wonder why the fishermen were cleaning their nets. This explanation can help you choose good words for "were washing" and "nets."

they motioned to their partners in the other boat (Luke 5:7 ULB)

* motioned - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms. 

* This note can help you understand what kind of motion the people made. It was a motion that people would be able to see from a distance. This will help you choose a good word or phrase for "motioned."

He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even while in his mother's womb. (Luke 1:14 ULB)

*	even while in his mother's womb - The word "even" here indicates that this is especially surprising news. People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby's being filled with the Holy Spirit.

* This note can help you understand what the word "even" means in this sentence, so you can find a way of showing how surprising this was.

Notes with Synonyms and Equivalent Phrases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

Sometimes immediately after the bolded words and hyphen there is a phrase in double quotation marks. This phrase means the same as the bolded words from the ULB and it can replace it in your translation. It may clarify who or what a pronoun refers to, or it may use words that you understand better.

**Translation Notes Examples**

'Make ready the way of the Lord, (Luke 3:4 ULB)

* the way - "the path" or "the road"

* In this example, the words "the path" or the words "the road" can replace the words "the way" in the ULB. You can decide whether it is natural to say "way," "path," or "road" in your language.

whoever has food should do likewise." (Luke 3:10 ULB)

* do likewise - "do the same thing"

* In this example, the words "do the same thing" can replace the words "do likewise" in the ULB. You, as the translator, can decide what is natural for your language.

Notes with Alternate Translations (AT)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Description**

An alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language has a different form. The alternate translation should  be used only when the ULB form or content would give a wrong meaning or would be unclear or unnatural.
The alternate translation suggestion may involve, for example, stating implicit information clearly, changing passive voice to active, or rewording rhetorical questions as statements. The notes often explain why there is an alternate translation and have a link to a page that explains the topic.

**Translation Notes Examples**

The "AT:" indicates that this is an alternate translation. Some examples are:

*Making Implicit Information Clear*

it is the law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree or statute that the king issues can be changed. (Daniel 6:15 ULB)

*no decree...can be changed - An additional sentence may be added here to aid in understanding. AT: "no decree...can be changed. So they must throw Daniel into the pit of lions." (See: Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information)

* The additional sentence shows what the speaker wanted the king to understand from his reminder that the king's decrees and statutes cannot be changed. Translators may need to state some things clearly in the translation that the original speaker or writer left unstated or implicit.

*Passive to Active*

to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven. (Luke 12:10 ULB)

* it will not be forgiven - This can be expressed with an active verb. AT: God will not forgive him. This can also be expressed in a positive way using a verb that means the opposite of "forgive." AT: "God will consider him guilty forever" (See: Active or Passive)

* Translators whose languages do not have passive sentences will need to know how they can translate passive sentences that they find in the Bible.

*Rhetorical Question*

Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? (Acts 9:4 ULB)*

* why are you persecuting me? - The Lord used this question to rebuke Saul. In some languages a statement would be more clear. AT: "You are persecuting me!" (See: `Rhetorical Question <https://dw.door43.org/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_rquestion>`_)

Notes That Include a Quote from the UDB
Description
There may not be a note if the Unlocked Dynamic Bible provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion a note may include text from the UDB as a suggested translation. In that case the text from the UDB will be followed by "(UDB)."
Translation Notes Examples
they implored him to stay with them (John 4:40 ULB)
they urged him to stay a longer time with them (John 4:40 UDB)
	implored him - "begged him" or "urged him" (UDB)
Here the suggested translation for the words 'implored him' is 'begged him.' The words, 'urged him' from the UDB mean the same thing and are included as another suggestion.
When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face (Luke 5:12 ULB)
When he saw Jesus, he bowed down to the ground (Luke 5:12 UDB)
	he fell on his face - "he knelt and touched the ground with his face" or "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB)
Here the words from the UDB are provided as another translation suggestion.
Notes That Have Alternate Meanings
Description
Alternate meanings refer to when there are different understandings of what a word or phrase means.
The note will have the ULB text followed by an explanation starting with the words "Possible meanings are." The meanings are numbered, and the first one is most likely correct. If a meaning is given in a way that it can be used as a translation, it will have quote marks around it.
The translator needs to decide which meaning to translate. Translators may choose the first meaning, or they may choose one of the other meanings if the people in their community use and respect another Bible version that has one of those other meanings.
Translation Notes Examples
You are like a young lion among the nations, like a monster in the seas (Ezekiel 32:2 ULB)
	like a monster in the seas - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.
This note has the ULB text followed by two meanings. The note starts with 'Possible meanings are,' and the meanings are numbered. The first meaning is most likely correct.
But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees (Luke 5:8 ULB)
	fell down at Jesus' knees - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
This note explains what 'fell down at Jesus' knees" might mean. The first meaning is most likely correct, but the other meanings are also possible. If your language does not have a general word that could refer to any of these actions, you may need to use a word that shows specifically how Simon Peter did this.
Notes with Possible Meanings
Description
Sometimes Bible scholars do not know for sure, or do not agree on, what a particular phrase or sentence in the Bible means. Some reasons for this include:
1.	There are minor differences in the ancient Bible texts.
2.	A word may have more than one meaning or use.
3.	It may not be clear what a word (such as a pronoun) refers to in a particular phrase.
Translation Notes Examples
When many scholars say that a word or phrase means one thing, and many others say that it means other things, we show the most common meanings that they give. Our notes for these situations begin with "Possible meanings are" and then give a numbered list. We recommend that you use the first meaning given. However, if people in your community have access to another Bible that uses one of the other possible meanings, you may decide that it is better to use that meaning.
But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord." (Luke 5:8 ULB)
	fell down at Jesus' knees - Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
Translation Strategies
1.	Translate it in such a way that the reader could understand either meaning as a possibility.
2.	If it is not possible to do that in your language, then choose a meaning and translate it with that meaning.
3.	If not choosing a meaning would make it hard for the readers to understand the passage in general, then choose a meaning and translate it with that meaning.
Notes That Identify Figures of Speech
Description
Figures of speech are ways of saying things that use words in non-literal ways. That is, the meaning of a figure of speech is not the same as the more direct meaning of its words. There are many different types of figures of speech.
In the translationNotes there will be an explanation about the meaning of a figure of speech that is in the passage. Sometimes an alternate translation is provided. This is marked as "AT," which is the initial letters of "alternate translation." There will also be a link to a translationAcademy page that gives additional information and translation strategies for that kind of figure of speech.
In order to translate the meaning, you need to be able to recognize the figure of speech and know what it means in the source language. Then you can choose either a figure of speech or a direct way to communicate that same meaning in the target language.
Translation Notes Examples
Many will come in my name and say, 'I am he,' and they will lead many astray. (Mark 13:6 ULB)
	Many will come in my name - The word "name" represents the authority of Jesus. AT: "Many will come, claiming my authority and permission." (See: Metonymy)
The figure of speech in this note is metonymy. The note explains the metonymy in this passage and gives an alternate translation. After that, there is a link to the tA page about metonymy. Click on the link to learn about metonymy and general strategies for translating metonymys.
"You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? (Luke 3:7 ULB)
	You offspring of poisonous snakes - This is a word picture. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: "You evil poisonous snakes!" or "You are evil like poisonous snakes." (See: Metaphor)
The figure of speech in this note is metaphor. The note explains the metaphor and gives two alternate translations. After that, there is a link to the tA page about metaphors. Click on the link to learn about metaphors and general strategies for translating them.
Notes That Identify Indirect and Direct Quotes
Description
There are two kinds of quotations: direct quotation and indirect quotation. When translating a quotation, translators need to decide whether to translate it as a direct quotation or an indirect quotation. (See: Direct and Indirect Quotations)
When there is a direct or indirect quote in the ULB, the notes may have an option for translating it as the other kind of quote. The translation suggestion may start with "It can be translated as a direct quote:" or "It can be translated as an indirect quote:" and it will be followed by that kind of quote. This may be followed by a link to the information page called "Direct and Indirect Quotations."
There is a likely to be a note about direct and indirect quotes when a quote has another quote inside of it, because these can be confusing. In some languages it may be more natural to translate one of these quotes with a direct quote and the other quote with an indirect quote. The note will end with a link to the information page called "Quotes within Quotes."
Translation Notes Examples
He instructed him to tell no one (Luke 5:14 ULB)
	to tell no one - This can be translated as a direct quote: "Do not tell anyone." The implied information is "that you have been healed." (See: Direct and Indirect Quotations)
Here the translation suggestion is to change the indirect quote to a direct quote.
At the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn."'" (Matthew 13:30 ULB)
	I will say to the reapers, "First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn" - You can translate this as an indirect quote: "I will tell the reapers to first gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, then gather the wheat into my barn." (See: Direct and Indirect Quotations)
Here the translation suggestion is to change the direct quote to an indirect quote.
Notes for Long ULB Phrases
Description
Sometimes there are notes for a phrase and separate notes for portions of that phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is explained first, and its parts afterward.
Translation Notes Examples
But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath (Romans 2:5 ULB)
	But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart - Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: Metaphor and Metonymy)
	hardness and unrepentant heart - The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: Doublet)
In this example the first note explains the the metaphor and metonymy, and the second explains the doublet in the same passage.

Translate Unknowns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How do I translate words like lion, fig tree, mountain, priest, or temple when people in my culture have never seen these things and we do not have a word for them?
Description
Unknowns are things that occur in the source text that are not known to the people of your culture. The translationWords pages and the translationNotes will help you understand what they are. After you understand them, you will need to find ways to refer to those things so that people who read your translation will understand what they are.
We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:17 ULB)
Bread is a particular food made by mixing finely crushed grains with oil, and then cooking the mixture so that it is dry. (Grains are the seeds of a kind of grass.) In some cultures people do not have bread or know what it is.
Reason this is a translation issue
	Readers may not know some of the things that are in the Bible because those things are not part of their own culture.
	Readers may have difficulty understanding a text if they do not know some of the things that are mentioned in it.

Translation Principles
	Use words that are already part of your language if possible.
	Keep expressions short if possible.
	Represent God's commands and historical facts accurately.

Examples from the Bible
I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for jackals (Jeremiah 9:11 ULB)
Jackals are wild animals like dogs that live in only a few parts of the world. So they are not known in many places.
Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly ravenous wolves. (Matthew 7:15 ULB)
If wolves do not live where the translation will be read, the readers may not understand that they are fierce, wild animals like dogs that attack and eat sheep.
Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was mixed with myrrh. But he refused to drink it. (Mark 15:23ULB)
People may not know what myrrh is and that it was used as a medicine.
to him who made great lights (Psalm 136:7ULB)
Some languages have terms for things that give light, like the sun and fire, but they have no general term for lights.
your sins ... will be white like snow (Isaiah 1:18 ULB)
People in many parts of the world have not seen snow, but they may have seen it in pictures.
Translation Strategies
Here are ways you might translate a term that is not known in your language:
1.	Use a phrase that describes the part of the meaning that is important in the particular verse being translated.
2.	Substitute something similar from your language if doing so does not falsely represent a historical fact.
3.	Copy the word from another language, and add a general word or descriptive phrase to help people understand it.
4.	Use a word that is more general in meaning.
5.	Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning.

Examples of Translation Strategies Applied
1. Use a phrase that describes the part of the meaning that is important in the particular verse being translated.
	Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly ravenous wolves. (Matthew 7:15 ULB)
	"Beware of false prophets, those who come to you in sheep's clothing, but are truly hungry and dangerous animals."
	We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:17 ULB)
	"We have here only five loaves of baked grain seeds and two fish"
2. Substitute something similar from your language if doing so does not falsely represent a historical fact.
	your sins ... will be white like snow (Isaiah 1:18 ULB) This verse is not about snow. It uses snow in a figure of speech to help people understand how white something will be.
	"your sins ... will be white like milk"
	"your sins ... will be white like the moon"
3. Copy the word from another language, and add a general word or descriptive phrase to help people understand it.
	Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was mixed with myrrh. But he refused to drink it.(Mark 15:23 ULB) - People may understand better what myrrh is if it is used with the general word "medicine."
	"Then they tried to give Jesus wine that was mixed with a medicine called myrrh. But he refused to drink it."
	We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:17 ULB) - People may understand better what bread is if it is used with a phrase that tells what it is made of (seeds) and how it is prepared (crushed and baked).
	"We have here only five loaves of baked crushed seed bread and two fish"
4. Use a word that is more general in meaning.
	I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for jackals (Jeremiah 9:11 ULB)
	"I will turn Jerusalem into piles of ruins, a hideout for wild dogs"
	We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish (Matthew 14:17 ULB)
	"We have here only five loaves of baked food and two fish"
5. Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning.
	to him who made great lights (Psalm 136:7 ULB)
	"to him who made the sun and the moon"

Assumed Knowledge and Implicit Information
Assumed knowledge is whatever a speaker assumes his audience knows before he speaks and gives them some kind of information. There are two types information.
	Explicit information is what the speaker states directly.
	Implicit information is what the speaker does not state directly because he expects his audience to be able to learn it from what he says.
Description
When someone speaks or writes, he has something specific that he wants people to know. He normally states this directly. This is explicit information.
The speaker assumes that his audience already knows certain things that they will think about in order to understand this information. Normally he does not tell people these things, although what he says may remind them. This is called assumed knowledge.
The speaker does not always directly state everything that he expects his audience to learn from what he says. Information that he expects people to learn from what he says even though he does not state it directly is implicit information.
Examples from the Bible
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." (Matthew 8:20 ULB)
Jesus did not say what foxes and birds use holes and nests for, because he assumed that the scribe would have known that foxes sleep in holes in the ground and birds sleep in their nests. This is assumed knowledge. Jesus did not directly say here "I am the Son of Man" but, if the scribe did not already know it, then that fact would be implicit information that he could learn because Jesus referred to himself that way. Jesus did not state explicitly that he travelled a lot and did not have a house that he slept in every night. That is implicit information that the scribe could learn when Jesus said that he had nowhere to lay his head.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. (Matthew 11:21, 22 ULB)
Jesus assumed that the people he was speaking to knew that Tyre and Sidon were very wicked, and that the day of judgment is a time when God will judge every person. Jesus also knew that the people he was talking to believed that they were good and did not need to repent. Jesus did not need to tell them these things. This is all assumed knowledge.
An important piece of implicit information here is that because the people he was speaking to did not repent, they would be judged more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon would be judged.
Why do your disciples violate the traditions of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat. (Matthew 15:2 ULB)
One of the traditions of the elders was a ceremony in which people would wash their hands in order to be ritually clean before eating. People thought that in order to be righteous, they had to follow all the traditions of the elders. This was assumed knowledge that the Pharisees who were speaking to Jesus expected him to know. They were accusing his disciples of not following the traditions. This is implicit information that they wanted him to understand from what they said.
Active or Passive
Some languages have both active and passive sentences. In active sentences, the subject does the action. In passive sentences the subject is the one that the action is done to. Here are some examples with their subjects underlined:
	ACTIVE: My father built the house in 2010.
	PASSIVE: The house was built in 2010.
Translators whose languages do not have passive sentences will need to know how they can translate passive sentences that they find in the Bible. Other translators will need to decide when to use a passive sentence and when not to.
Description
Some languages have both active and passive forms of sentences.
	In the ACTIVE form, the subject does the action and is always mentioned.
	In the PASSIVE form, the action is done to the subject and the one who does the action is not always mentioned.
In the examples of active and passive sentences below, we have underlined the subject.
ACTIVE: My father built the house in 2010.
PASSIVE: The house was built by my father in 2010. 
PASSIVE: The house was built in 2010. (This does not tell who did the action.)
All languages have active forms. Some languages have passive forms, and some do not.  The passive form is not used for the same reasons in all of the languages that have it.
Purposes for the passive:
	The speaker is talking about the person or thing the action was done to, not about the person who did the action.
	The speaker does not want to tell who did the action. 
	The speaker does not know who did the action.
Translation Principles Regarding the Passive
	Translators whose language does not use passive forms will need to find another way to express the idea. 
	Translators whose language has passive forms will need to understand why the passive is used in a particular sentence in the Bible and decide whether or not to use a passive form for that purpose in his translation of the sentence.
Examples from the Bible
And their shooters shot at your soldiers from off the wall, and some of the king's servants were killed, and your servant Uriah the Hittite was killed too. (2 Samuel 11:24 ULB)
This means that the enemies shooters shot and killed some of the king's servants, including Uriah. The point is what happened to the king's servants and Uriah, not who shot them.
In the morning when the men of the town got up, the altar of Baal was broken down … (Judges 6:28 ULB)
The men of the town saw what had happened to the altar of Baal, but they did not know who broke it down.
No stonework was seen there. (1 Kings 6:18 ULB)
This means that no one saw stonework there. The point is that no stonework was done there.
Translation Strategies
If you decide that it is better to translate without a passive form, here are some strategies you might consider.
1.	Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who or what did the action.
2.	Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who or what did the action.
3.	Use a different verb.
Examples of Translation Strategies Applied
1. Use the same verb in an active sentence and tell who did the action.
	A loaf of bread was given him every day from the street of the bakers. (Jeremiah 37:21 ULB)
	The king's servants gave Jeremiah a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers.
2. Use the same verb in an active sentence, and do not tell who did the action. Instead use a generic expression like "they," or "people," or "someone." 
	It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea (Luke 17:2 ULB)
	It would be better for him if they were to put a millstone around his neck and throw him into the sea.
	It would be better for him if someone were to put a heavy stone around his neck and throwhim into the sea.
3. Use a different verb in an active sentence. 
	A loaf of bread was given him every day from the street of the bakers. (Jeremiah 37:21 ULB)
	He received a loaf of bread every day from the street of the bakers.

Many times the Bible uses metonymy. If you do not recognize it as a metonymy you will not understand the passage or worse yet, get the wrong understanding of the passage. 
Description
Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. A metonym is a word or phrase used as a substitute for something it is associated with.
and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (1 John 1:7 ULB)
The blood represents Christ's death.
He took the cup in the same way after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. (Luke 22:20 ULB)
The cup represents the wine that is in the cup.
Metonymy can be used
	as a shorter way of referring to something
	to make an abstract idea more meaningful by referring to it with the name of a concrete object associated with it.
Reason this is a translation issue
	If a metonym is used, people need to be able to understand what it represents.
Examples from the Bible
The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David. (Luke 1:32 ULB)
A throne represents the authority of a king. Throne is a metonym for "kingly authority," "kingship" or, "reign." This means that God would make him become the king who was to follow King David.
Immediately his mouth was opened (Luke 1:64 ULB)
The mouth here represents the power to speak. This means that he was able to talk again.
who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming? (Luke 3:7 ULB)
The word "wrath" or "anger" is a metonym for "punishment." God was extremely angry with the people and, as a result, he would punish them.
Translation Strategies
If people would easily understand the metonym, consider using it. Otherwise, here is an option.
1.	Use the metonym along with the name of the thing it represents.
2.	Use the name of the thing the metonym represents.

Metaphor
Description
A metaphor is the use of words to speak of one thing as if it were a different thing. Sometimes a speaker does this in ways that are very common in the language. At other times, a speaker does this in ways that are less common in the language and that might even be unique.
1. First we will discuss very common metaphors.
The metaphors that are very common in a language are usually not very vivid. They may even be "dead." Examples in English are "table leg," "family tree," and "the price of food is going up." Examples in biblical languages are "hand" to mean "power," "face" to mean "presence," and "clothing" to mean emotions or moral qualities.
Metaphors like these are in constant use in the world's languages, because they serve as convenient ways to organize thought. In general, languages speak of abstract qualities, such as power, presence, emotions, and moral qualities, as if they were objects that can be seen or held, or as if they were body parts, or as if they were events that you can watch happen.
When these metaphors are used in their normal ways, the speaker and audience do not normally even regard them as figurative language. This is why, for example, it would be wrong to translate the English expression, "The price of petrol is going up" into another language in a way that would draw undeserved attention to it, because English speakers do not view it as a vivid expression, that is, as an unusual expression that carries meaning in an unusual manner.
For a description of important patterns of this kind of metaphor, please see Biblical Imagery - Common Patterns and the pages it will direct you to.
2. Next we will discuss the less common metaphors, metaphors that are sometimes even unique in a language.
The speaker usually produces metaphors of this kind in order to emphasize the importance of what he is talking about. For example,
For you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. (Malachi 4:2ULB)
Here God speaks about his salvation as if it were the sun rising to shine its rays on the people whom he loves. And he speaks of the sun's rays as if they were wings. Also, he speaks of these wings as if they were bringing medicine that would heal his people.
We call this kind of metaphor "live." It is unique in the biblical languages, which means that it is very memorable.
Parts of a Metaphor
When talking about metaphors, it can be helpful to talk about their parts. The thing someone speaks of is called the topic. The thing he calls it is the image. The way that they are similar is the point of comparison.
In the metaphor below, the speaker describes the woman he loves as a rose. The woman (his "love") is the topic and the red rose is the image. Both are beautiful and delicate.
	My love is a red, red rose.
1. Sometimes the topic and the image are both stated clearly.
Jesus said to them. "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will never thirst." (John 6:35 ULB)
Jesus called himself the bread of life. The topic is "I" and the image is "bread." Bread is a food that people ate all the time. Just as people need to eat food in order to have physical life, people need to trust in Jesus in order to have spiritual life.
2. Sometimes only the image is stated clearly.
Produce fruits that are worthy of repentance (Luke 3:8 ULB)
The image here is "fruits". The topic is not stated, but it is actions or behavior. Trees can produce good fruit or bad fruit, and people can produce good behavior or bad behavior. Fruits that are worthy of repentance are good behavior that is appropriate for people who have repented.
Purposes of this second kind of metaphor
	One purpose of metaphor is to teach people about something that they do not know (the topic) by showing that it is like something that they already know (the image).
	Another purpose is to emphasize that something has a particular quality or to show that it has that quality in an extreme way.
	Another purpose is to lead people to feel the same way about one thing as they would feel toward another.
Reasons this is a translation issue
	People may not realize that a word is being used as an image in a metaphor.
	People may not be familiar with the thing that is used as an image.
	If the topic is not stated, people may not know what the topic is.
	People may not know how the topic and the image are alike.
Translation Principles
	Make the meaning of a metaphor as clear to the target audience as it was to the original audience.
	Do not make the meaning of a metaphor more clear to the target audience than it was to the original audience.
Examples from the Bible
And yet, Yahweh, you are our father; we are the clay. You are our potter; and we all are the work of your hand. (Isaiah 64:8 ULB)
The example above has two metaphors. The topics are "we" and "you" and the images are "clay and "potter." Just as a potter takes clay and forms a jar or dish out of it, God makes us into what he wants us to be.
Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." The disciples reasoned among themselves and said, "It is because we took no bread." (Matthew 16:6-7ULB)
Jesus used a metaphor, but his disciples did not realize it. When he said "yeast," they thought he was talking about bread, but "yeast" was the image in his metaphor about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Since the disciples did not understand what Jesus meant, it would not be good to state clearly here what Jesus meant.
Translation Strategies
If people would understand the metaphor in the same way that the original readers would have understood it, go ahead and use it. If not, here are some other strategies.
1.	If the metaphor is common and seems to be a normal way to say something in the biblical language, express the main idea in the simplest way preferred by your language.
2.	If the target audience would think that the phrase should be understood literally, change the metaphor to a simile. Some languages do this by adding words such as "like" or "as."
3.	If the target audience would not know the image, see Translate Unknowns for ideas on how to translate that image.
4.	If the target audience would not use that image for that meaning, use an image from your own culture instead. Be sure that it is an image that could have been possible in Bible times.
5.	Or, if the target audience would not use that image for that meaning, simply state the truth that the metaphor was used to communicate.
6.	If the target audience would not know what the topic is, then state the topic clearly. (However, do not do this if the original audience did not know what the topic was.)
7.	If the target audience would not know how the topic is like the image, state it clearly.

Biblical Imagery – Common Patterns
This page discusses ideas that are paired together in limited ways. For a discussion of more complex pairings, see Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models.
Description
In all languages, most metaphors come from broad patterns of pairings of ideas in which one idea represents another. For example, some languages have the pattern of pairing height with "much" and pairing being low with "not much," so that height represents "much" and being low represents "not much." This could be because when there is a lot of something in a pile, that pile will be high. So also if something costs a lot money, in some languages people would say that the price is high, or if a city has more people in it than it used to have, we might say that its number of people has gone up. Likewise if someone gets thinner and loses weight, we would say that their weight has gone down.
The patterns found in the Bible are often unique to the Hebrew and Greek languages. It is useful to recognize these patterns because they repeatedly present translators with the same problems on how to translate them. Once translators think through how they will handle these translation challenges, they will be ready to meet them anywhere.
For example, one pattern of pairings in the Bible is of walking with "behaving" and a path with a kind of behavior. In Psalm 1:1 the walking in the advice of the wicked represents doing what wicked people say to do.
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked (Psalm 1:1)
This pattern is also seen in Psalm 119:32 where running in the path of God's commands represents doing what God commands. Since running is more intense than walking, the idea of running here might give the idea of doing this whole-heartedly.
I will run in the path of your commandments. (Psalm 119:32 ULB)
Reasons this is a translation Issue
These patterns present three challenges to anyone who wants to identify them:
(1) When looking at particular metaphors in the Bible, it is not always obvious what two ideas are paired with each other. For example, it may not be immediately obvious that the expression It is God who puts strength on me like a belt (Psalm 18:32 ULB) is based on the pairing of clothing with moral quality. In this case, the image of a belt represents strength. (See: "Clothing represents a moral quality" in Biblical Imagery - Man-made Objects)
(2) When looking at a particular expression, the translator needs to know whether or not it represents something. This can only be done by considering the surrounding text. The surrounding text shows us for example, whether "lamp" refers concretely to a container with oil and a wick for giving light or whether "lamp" is an image that represents life. (See: "FIRE or LAMP represents life" in Biblical Imagery - Natural Phenomena).
In 1 Kings 7:50, a lamp trimmer is a tool for trimming the wick on an ordinary lamp. In 2 Samuel 21:17 the lamp of Israel represents King David's life. When his men were concerned that he might "put out the lamp of Israel" they were concerned that he might be killed.
The cups, lamp trimmers, basins, spoons, and incense burners were all made of pure gold. (1 Kings 7:50)
Ishbibenob...intended to kill David. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah rescued David, attacked the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, "You must not go to battle anymore with us, so that you do not put out the lamp of Israel." (2 Samuel 21:16-17)
(3) Expressions that are based on these pairings of ideas frequently combine together in complex ways. Moreover, they frequently combine with—and in some cases are based on—common metonymies and cultural models. (See: Biblical Imagery - Common Metonymies and Biblical Imagery - Cultural Models.) For example, in 2 Samuel 14:7 below, "the burning coal" is an image for the life of the son, who represents what will cause people to remember his father. So there are two patterns of pairings here: the pairing of the burning coal with the life of the son, and the pairing of the son with the memory of his father.
They say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, so that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed.' And so they would also destroy the heir. Thus they will put out the burning coal that I have left, and they will leave for my husband neither name nor descendant on the surface of the earth. (2 Samuel 14:7 ULB)

Biblical Imagery – Cultural Models
Description
Cultural models are mental pictures of parts of life or behavior. These pictures help us imagine and talk about these topics. For example, Americans often think of marriage and friendship as if they were machines. Americans might say "His marriage is breaking down" or "Their friendship is going full speed ahead." In this example, human relationships are modeled as a MACHINE.
Some cultural models, or mental pictures, found in the Bible are listed below. First there are models for God, then models for humans, things, and experiences. Each heading has the model written in capital letters. That word or phrase does not necessarily appear in every verse, but the idea does.
God is modeled as a HUMAN BEING
Although the Bible explicitly denies that God is a human being, he is often spoken of as doing things that humans do. But God is not human, so when the Bible say that God speaks, we should not think that he has vocal chords that vibrate. And when it says something about him doing something with his hand, we should not think that he has a physical hand.
If we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any longer, we will die. (Deuteronomy 5:25 ULB)
I have been strengthened by the hand of Yahweh my God (Ezra 7:28 ULB)
The hand of God also came on Judah, to give them one heart to carry out the command of the king and leaders by the word of Yahweh (2 Chronicles 30:12 ULB)
The word "hand" here is a metonym that refers to God's power. (See: Metonymy)
God is modeled as a KING
For God is the King over all the earth; (Psalm 47:7 ULB)
For the kingdom is Yahweh's;
he is the ruler over the nations. (Psalm 22:28 ULB)
Your throne, God, is forever and ever;
a scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom. (Psalm 45:6 ULB)
This is what Yahweh says,
"Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. (Isaiah 66:1 ULB)
God reigns over the nations;
God sits on his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples have gathered together
to the people of the God of Abraham;
for the shields of the earth belong to God;
he is greatly exalted. (Psalm 47:8-9 ULB)
God is modeled as a SHEPHERD and his people are models as SHEEP
Yahweh is my shepherd; I will lack nothing. (Psalm 23:1 ULB)
His people are sheep.
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. (Psalm 95:7 ULB)
He leads his people like sheep.
He led his own people out like sheep and guided them through the wilderness like a flock. (Psalm 78:52 ULB)
He is willing to die in order to save his sheep.
I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me. The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this fold. Those, also, I must bring, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. (John 10:14-15 ULB)
God is modeled as a WARRIOR
Yahweh is a warrior; (Exodus 15:3 ULB)
Yahweh will go out as a warrior; he will proceed as a man of war. He will stir up his zeal.
He will shout, yes, he will roar his battle cries; he will show his enemies his power. (Isaiah 42:13 ULB)
Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power;
your right hand, Yahweh, has shattered the enemy. (Exodus 15:6 ULB
But God will shoot them;
suddenly they will be wounded with his arrows. (Psalm 65:7 ULB)
For you will turn them back; you will draw your bow before them. (Psalm 21:12 ULB)
A leader is modeled as a SHEPHERD and those he leads are modeled as SHEEP
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "Look...when Saul was king over us, it was you who led the Israelite army. Yahweh said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel.' " (2 Samuel 5:1-2 ULB)
"Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture—this is Yahweh's declaration." (Jeremiah 23:1 ULB)
Therefore be careful about yourselves, and about all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the assembly of the Lord, which he purchased with his own blood. 29I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, and not spare the flock. I know that from even among your own selves some men shall come and say corrupt things, in order to draw away the disciples after them. (Acts 20:28-30 ULB)
The eye is modeled as a LAMP
Variations of this model and the model of the EVIL EYE are found in many parts of the world. In most of the cultures represented in the Bible, these models included the following elements:
People see objects, not because of light around the object, but because of light that shines from their eyes onto those objects.
The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. (Matthew 6:22 ULB)
This light shining from the eyes carries with itself the viewer's character.
The appetite of the wicked craves evil; his neighbor sees no kindness in his eyes. (Proverbs 21:10 ULB)
Envy and cursing are modeled as looking with an EVIL EYE at someone, and favor is modeled as looking with a GOOD EYE at someone
The primary emotion of a person with the evil eye is envy. The Greek word translated as "envy" in Mark 7 is "eye," which refers here to an evil eye.
He said, "It is that which comes out of the person that defiles him. For from within a person, out of the heart, proceed evil thoughts…, envy …. (Mark 7:20-22 ULB)
The context for Matthew 20:15 includes the emotion of envy. "Is your eye evil?" means "Are you envious?"
Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? Or is your eye evil because I am good? (Matthew 20:15 ULB)
If a person's eye is evil is envious of other people's money.
The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore, if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body is full of darkness. Therefore, if the light that is in you is actually darkness, how great is that darkness! No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. (Matthew 6:22-24 ULB)
A person who is envious might put a curse or enchantment on someone by looking at him with an evil eye.
Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? (Galatians 3:1 ULB)
A person with a good eye can put a blessing on someone by looking at him.
If I have found favor in your eyes... (1 Samuel 27:5 ULB)
Life is modeled as BLOOD
In this model, the blood of a person or an animal represents its life.
But you must not eat meat with its life—that is its blood—in it. (Genesis 9:4 ULB)
If blood is spilled or shed, someone has been killed.
Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed, (Genesis 9:6 ULB)
In this way, this person would not die by the hand of the one who wanted to avenge the blood that was shed, until the accused person would first stand before the assembly. (Joshua 20:9 ULB)
If blood cries out, nature itself is crying out for vengeance on a person who killed someone. (This also includes personification, because the blood is pictured as someone that can cry out. See: Personification)
Yahweh said, "What have you done? Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground. (Genesis 4:10 ULB)
A country is modeled as a WOMAN, and its gods are modeled as HER HUSBAND
It came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, the people of Israel turned again and prostituted themselves by worshiping the Baals. They made Baal Berith their god. (Judges 8:33 ULB)
The nation of Israel is modeled as GOD'S SON
When Israel was a young man I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. (Hosea 11:1 ULB)
The sun is modeled as BEING IN A CONTAINER AT NIGHT
Yet their words go out over all the earth and their speech to the end of the world. He has pitched a tent for the sun among them. The sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and like a strong man who rejoices when he runs his race. (Psalm 19:4-5 ULB)
Psalm 110 pictures the sun as being in the womb before it comes out in the morning.
from the womb of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew. (Psalm 110:3 ULB)
Things that can move fast are modeled as having WINGS
This is especially true of things that move in the air or the sky.
The sun is modeled as a disc with wings, which allow it to "fly" through the air from east to west during the daytime. In Psalm 139, "the wings of the morning" refers to the sun. In Malachi 4 God called himself the "sun of righteousness" and he spoke of the sun as having wings.
If I fly away on the wings of the morning and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea. (Psalm 139:9 ULB)
But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. (Malachi 4:2 ULB)
The wind moves quickly and is modeled as having wings.
He was seen flying on the wings of the wind. (2 Sam. 22:11 ULB)
He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. (Psalm 18:10 ULB)
you walk on the wings of the wind (Psalm 104:3 ULB)
Futility is modeled as something that the WIND can blow away
In this model, the wind blows away things that are worthless, and they are gone.
Psalm 1 and Job 27 show that wicked people are worthless and will not live long.
The wicked are not so,
but are instead like the chaff that the wind drives away. (Psalm 1:4 ULB)
The east wind carries him away, and he leaves;
it sweeps him out of his place. (Job 27:21 ULB)
The writer of Ecclesiastes says that everything is worthless.
Like a vapor of mist,
like a breeze in the wind,
everything vanishes, leaving many questions.
What profit does mankind gain from all the work that they labor at under the sun? (Ecclesiastes 1:2-3 ULB)
In Job 30:15, Job complains that his honor and prosperity are gone.
Terrors are turned upon me;
my honor is driven away as if by the wind;
my prosperity passes away as a cloud. (Job 30:15 ULB)
Human warfare is modeled as DIVINE WARFARE
When there was a war between nations, people believed that the gods of those nations were also at war.
This happened while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, those whom Yahweh had killed among them, for he also inflicted punishment on their gods. (Numbers 33:4 ULB)
And what nation is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom you, God, went and rescued for yourself?...You drove out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you rescued from Egypt. (2 Samuel 7:23 ULB)
The servants of the king of Aram said to him, "Their god is a god of the hills. That is why they were stronger than we were. But now let us fight against them in the plain, and surely there we will be stronger than they." (1 Kings 20:23 ULB)
Constraints in life are modeled as PHYSICAL BOUNDARIES
The verses below are not about real physical boundaries but about difficulties or the lack of difficulties in life.
He has built a wall around me, and I cannot escape. He has made my shackles heavy. (Lamentations 3:7 ULB)
He has blocked my path with walls of hewn stone; every way I take is crooked. (Lamentations 3:9 ULB)
Measuring lines have been laid for me in pleasant places (Psalm 16:6 ULB)
Dangerous places are modeled as NARROW PLACES
In Psalm 4 David asks God to rescue him.
Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness;
give me room when I am hemmed in.
Have mercy on me and listen to my prayer. (Psalm 4:1 ULB)
A distressing situation is modeled as a WILDERNESS
When Job was distressed because of all the sad things that happened to him, he spoke as if he were in a wilderness. Jackals and ostriches are animals that live in the wilderness.
My heart is troubled and does not rest;
days of affliction have come on me.
I go about with darkened skin but not because of the sun;
I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
I am a brother to jackals,
a companion of ostriches. (Job 30:27-29 ULB)
Wellbeing is modeled as PHYSICAL CLEANLINESS, and evil is modeled as PHYSICAL DIRTINESS
Leprosy is a disease. If a person had it, he was said to be unclean.
Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing. Be clean." Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. (Matthew 8:2-3 ULB)
An "unclean spirit" is an evil spirit.
When an unclean spirit has gone away from a man, it passes through waterless places and looks for rest, but does not find it. (Matthew 12:43 ULB)
