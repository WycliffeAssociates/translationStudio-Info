A footnote is additional text that usually appears at the bottom of a book’s page and is referenced within the page.
In translationStudio, a footnote is shown as a black page icon that you click to display the footnote.
Footnotes can provide further explanation when:

*	There are proper names, words or terms that differ between various Bible versions

* There are missing words or verses in the ULB. (There may be text in one Bible version that is not present in the ULB.)

To translate a footnote:

1)	Copy the footnote.

    *	Click the footnote icon to open it (for example, in 1 Cor. 10:28)  

    * Highlight the text of the footnote.

    *	Copy the footnote text – [Ctrl + C] on Windows.

    * Dismiss the footnote.
 
2)	Paste the footnote into the translated text.

    *	If the chunk has been marked “done”, click the toggle at bottom right of the translated chunk.
 
    * Click the Edit icon (pencil).
 
    * Click the appropriate spot in the translated text.

    * Paste the footnote text – [Ctrl + V] on Windows).
 
3)	Add footnote coding. Footnote coding identifies the text as a footnote and separates it from the surrounding text. To add footnote coding:

    * Type the following text at the beginning of the footnote, separated from the surrounding text by spaces:

            \\f + \\ft

    * Type the following text at the end of the footnote, separated from the surrounding text by spaces: 
    
            \\f* 
 
    * If there is a quote within the footnote:
      
      * Replace the beginning quotation mark with: 
      
            \\fqa and a space
      
      *	Replace the ending quotation mark with: 
      
            a space and \\fqb 
 
4)	Translate the footnote text.

    * Translate the text of the footnote.
 
    * Click the check mark to save the edits on the chunk.
 
    * Mark the chunk as done.
